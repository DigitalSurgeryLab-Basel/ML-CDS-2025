# Phase concept: (1) Attributes in "phase_*" are used for the corresponding phase only, others are used in all phases.
# Attributes in "common" are explicitly injected into "phase_*" (see e.g.
# https://tutorialreference.com/yaml/yaml-anchors-and-alias for the technical basis). (2) Places where injection is used
# usually imply the creation of different instances for each phase (e.g. datasets), while places where "phase_*" is used
# without injection usually imply the creation of one instance that is treated differently in different phases (e.g.
# encoders/decoders).

# Model state concept: In the phase marked for optimization, an encoder or decoder component state can be "hot" (allows
# gradient flow, gets updated), "fluid" (allows gradient flow, does not get updated), or "frozen" (does not allow
# gradient flow, does not get updated). In the remaining phase(s), the component's state is frozen implicitly.
